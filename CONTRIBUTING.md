Please stick as closely as possible to the guidelines. That way, we ensure that you have a smooth experience contributing to this project.

### General Rules:

These are, in general, rules that you should be following while contributing to an Open-Source Pieces project:

- Be Nice, Be Respectful (BNBR)
- Check if the Issue you created already exists or not
- When creating a new issue, make sure you describe the issue clearly
- Use tags to mark your issue as “draft” (we will remove the draft tag once we assign the proper issue tags to the created issue)
- Make proper commit messages and document your PR well
- Always add comments to your code
- Follow proper code conventions because writing clean code is important
- Add @jordan-pieces as a reviewer to be assigned to another maintainer or to be reviewed
- Issues will be assigned on a "First Come, First Served" basis
- Once an issue has been assigned, if we don’t receive any reply/response in a week, we will reassign the issue to someone else and remove the assignee
- Do mention (@jordan-pieces) the project maintainer if your PR isn't reviewed within three days
