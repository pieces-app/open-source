# Pieces Google Summer of Code'24 Participant Guide

## **Communication**

Welcome to the Pieces Open Source GSoC projects page. 

Your enthusiasm and unique perspectives are valuable additions to our open-source community. We believe in fostering an inclusive environment where everyone can learn, grow, and collaborate. 

Our [Discord server](discord.com/getpieces) is the best place to connect with other open source contributors or our maintainers. To make the most out of our discord server, ask your questions under the Open Source Chat channel, having the messages in the right place makes it easy for our team to respond quite fast. 


## **General suggestions for contributors**
- **Code and prototypes are preferred over detailed documentation**:
  Rather than investing extensive time in detailed application documents or unreliable estimates, we encourage applicants to channel their efforts into creating functional prototypes. The emphasis lies on tangible code and prototypes, 

- **Project goal setting**:
 While project ideas articulate overarching goals, they acknowledge the need for further refinement during the project lifecycle. Students are encouraged to conduct independent research, present innovative solutions, and be adept at navigating uncertainty and overcoming challenges that may arise throughout the project
